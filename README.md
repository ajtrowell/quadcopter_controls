# Control Theory Simulator

Control Theory game created with [p5.js.](http://p5js.org/)

The goal of this project is to create a somewhat accurate physics 
simulation of a quadcopter, then create a control loop to stabilize 
it. Eventually detailed plots and interactive controls should help 
with tuning the control system. Later, random variations in thrust 
power and wind gusts could help provide a noisier environment for 
testing the control loop.

Manual controls will also be available to help the user appreciate 
the complexity of the control system's problem. <br><br>
    ** Present Controls: **
* Arrow keys provide full thrust in translation.
* Spacebar toggles the 'autopilot.'
* The Left mouse button indicates a new autopilot target position.
